Title: Final Project

Description (or at least some ideas): an animated educational website (javascript) that explains the science behind fractals. (found a code that generates fractals in javascript which you can make look pretty cool). A simple game. (looked at the monopoly code, didn't look too bad to program actually.) Some sort of iphone app (If we wanted to go down that road)[iphone app, swift language]. Some sort of audio application, plays music and other cool stuff (I sort of know how to program those as of now using JUCE) [c++]
