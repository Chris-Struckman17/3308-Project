Title: SoundStorm

Description (Some of our ideas): A simple game. (looked at the monopoly code, didn't look too bad to program actually.) Some sort of iphone app (If we wanted to go down that road)[iphone app, swift language]. Some sort of audio application, plays music and other cool stuff (I sort of know how to program those as of now using JUCE) [c++], A webpage that takes an audio file and plays it along with visuals that repsond to the frequency of the sound.
A simple, mp3 player application with audio filters and visualizer capabilities. A chrome extention that gives soundcloud many needed features such as queuing, sorting, visualization, access to local files (like spotify). 

Vision Statement: "Music Made Better" Our extention is a modification of the Soundcloud api that makes listening to music easier. Queuing songs is now possible to form temporary playlists with ease. Local files are now playable from soundcloud. 
As a music enthusiast I want complete control of my songs so that I can optomize my audio listening experience.

Motivation: To gain experience working with/modifying existing web programs and creating our own chrome extensions using Java, CSS, and HTML. 

Mitigation strategy: Delegate work evenly throughout the group such that everyone is working/improving on different aspects of the project (ie. One person works on the application's web functionality, another might work on the features.)

Requirements

Methodolody: Agile Method

Project Tracking: Trello

Risks: Not much experience writing software with these Javascript, CSS or HTTP. but we're definitely learning.
