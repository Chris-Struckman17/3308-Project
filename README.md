=======
Title: SoundStorm (now sound++)

Description: A chrome extention that gives soundcloud many needed features such as queuing, sorting, visualization, access to local files (like spotify). 

Vision Statement: "Music Made Better" Our extension is a modification of the Soundcloud api that makes listening to music easier and more enjoyable. Queuing songs is now possible to form temporary playlists with ease. Local files are now made acessible and can be put in playlists with streamed music.


Motivation: To gain experience working with/modifying existing web programs and creating our own chrome extensions using Java, CSS, and HTML. 

Mitigation strategy: Delegate work evenly throughout the group such that everyone is working/improving on different aspects of the project (ie. One person works on the application's web functionality, another might work on the features.)

Requirements
-Functional: 1.Extension should effectively add more features using the Soundcloud API.(8) 2.Specifically it should be able to play user specified songs without being in a playlist.(8) 3.It should also have the ablity to access a user's music (wherever that directory may be) and play songs from there as well as add these songs to playlists including songs that are streamed. (8)

-Non-Functional: 4.Extension should not decrease performance of the original website. 

-User: 5As a music enthusiast I want complete control of my songs so that I can optomize my audio listening experience.
